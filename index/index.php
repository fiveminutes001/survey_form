			The Brain Health Survey is a brief online self-assessment, which focuses on your medical
			and lifestyle risk factors for age-related cognitive decline and dementia. It will help you
			make lifestyle choices that have been shown to protect your brain against brain disorders
			like Alzheimer’s disease.

		<p>
			The Brain Health Survey is simple, easy and requires only 5-10 minutes of your time. You
			may use a computer, tablet, or smartphone to answer about 20 questions about your
			background, body weight and height, food choices, habits, physical and cognitive
			activities, sleep hygiene and few medical conditions.
			All questions must be answered to complete the survey and if you don’t know the answer
			you just tick “don’t know”.
			All you need to provide is your first name, email address and country of residence so we
			can email you back your Brain Health Survey Report.
